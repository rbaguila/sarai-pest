          treatment: 'Due to their small sizes and high rates of reproduction, thrips are difficult to control using classical biological control. All predators must be small and slender enough to penetrate the crevices where thrips hide while feeding, and then prey extensively on eggs and larvae. Only two families of parasitoid Hymenoptera are known to parasitize eggs and larvae, the Eulophidae and the Trichogrammatidae. Other biocontrol agents of adults and larvae include aphid wasps, anthocorid bugs of genus Orius, and phytoseiid mites. For this reason, many growers are occasionally forced to make limited use of pesticides to control thrips populations in the field and in greenhouses. Another effective strategy for pest thrips are biological insecticides, including Beauveria bassiana or Verticillium lecanii. These demonstrate a clear effect on eggs, larvae and adults of thrips. Insecticidal soap spray is effective against thrips. It is commercially available or can be made of certain types of household soap. Scientists in Japan report that significant reductions in larva and adult melon thripes occur when plants are illuminated with red light.',

When there are large populations, tunnels are found through most of the corm tissue and a short distance up the pseudostem.

In severe cases the young suckers whither and fail to develop. This pest can become a major pest, reducing plant growth and causing extensive plant fall outs. Typical symptoms of a severe infestation are reduced plant growth, choking of the bunch in the pseudostem, yellow leaves and weak or dying suckers.',

The newly emerged pseudostem borer is reddish brown but soon becomes uniformly dull black. The pseudostem borers are nocturnal and hide during the day in or around corms or in moist areas near the plant and in the trash. Unusually sluggish in their movements, they feign death when disturbed and seldom fly. Natural spread is very slow. Dispersal is primarily by the introduction of infested suckers and bits for planting. Eggs are laid singly in a shallow pit at the base of the pseudostem. They are elongate, oval, about 2 mm long and pearly white. The eggs are very hard to find because the oviposition site becomes covered by congealed sap. The soft, creamy-white, stout (up to 10 mm in length), legless larvae have a distinctly curved body, are swollen in the middle and have a hard brown head. Pupae are about the same size as the larvae. Inside the white pupal skin the structure of the future adult with its snout, wing buds, legs and antennae is visible.',

          treatment: 'Cultural Control-The most practical method of combating O. longicollis consists of prevention by means of clean culture, accompanied by trapping the adults. Clean culture should include the removal of trash which provides hiding places and, more especially, the removal of broken and decaying plants which serve as breeding places. The practice of cutting off the stems at a height varying from 2 to 7 feet and allowing these to remain until they disintegrate provides ideal breeding conditions for the beetles. One of these cut stems may have dozens of insects in all stages of their development (Hoffmann, 1933). In Assam, northern India, Isahaque (1978) found that dead banana plants remained succulent for a long time and therefore permitted the survival of larvae and pupae during the winter. He recommended the removal and burning of dry leaves and leaf sheaths, and dead or cut pseudostems, in the winter to help reduce weevil populations. Trapping can be done by placing cut pieces of stem in the field for the purpose of attracting beetles for oviposition. These traps are best destroyed at regular intervals, of short enough duration to prevent maturity of any larvae which might hatch. The traps should be visited frequently and the adults destroyed. Either the weevils are crushed or the traps burnt to kill the weevils. If very thin slices of stem are used as traps, they will be insufficient to allow the complete development to take place; Biological Control-The technique of release of sterile males may have potential in control of this weevil (Chiang, 1965). One-day-old male pupae were irradiated with X-rays and gamma-rays. The maximum practical dose for use in studies on control by the release of sterile males was 2000 R. Inundative releases of sterile males into banana plantations were made to compete with fertile males so that the number of viable offspring would be reduced. Apparently this approach to weevil control was not followed up; Host-plant Resistance-In India, Isahaque (1978) showed that the banana variety Bhimkal was completely free of infestation by O. longicollis. In addition Kaskal was highly resistant and Jahajee was resistant. Resistance in these three varieties appeared to be connected with their broad, thick and compact leaf-sheaths and pseudostems, although chemical antibiosis may also have been a contributing factor; Chemical Control-In India infested pseudostems have been fumigated after the initiation of flowering, otherwise there was a phytotoxic effect. Three aluminium phosphide tablets per plant were inserted 15 cm above ground level, at a depth of a quarter of the pseudostem diameter. After insertion, the entry hole was sealed (Anon., 1977); Integrated Pest Management-Wijesekara and Menike (1991) stated that it is possible to manage O. longicollis and Cosmopolites by a combination of cultural and chemical control. All infested plants are removed, the pseudostems split open and allowed to dry in the field (if convenient all pseudostems are remoned from field and destroyed by feeding to cows or pigs). The pseudostems of harvested banana plants are cut at ground level and carbofuran [a hazardous pesticide that is now banned] granules applied onto the cut surface, which is covered with another piece of pseudostem to make a trap. Twenty five such pseudostem traps per acre are randomly placed at the base of clumps once a month. Uninfested planting material should always be used for establishing a new plantation.',

Pineapple wilt may also result in the invasion of saprophytic organisms, which leads to the collapse of roots. Ultimately, plants may die as a result of infection by pineapple wilt via D. neobrevipes. D. neobrevipes also causes green spot disease, which is characterized by galls on leaves caused by a reaction between the plant and a secretion from the mealybugs.',

          symptoms: 'D. neobrevipes is usually found near the top of a host plant and feeds by sucking the sap from the plant tissue. This causes local lesions to form at the site of feeding. These lesions are bizonate, with a dark green centre surrounded by a lighter green area. D. neobrevipes also affects the plant’s photosyntheitic ability by producing sugary honeydew which facilitates the growth of sooty mould, blocking sunlight from reaching the leaves. The main damage that pineapple mealybugs such as D. neobrevipes cause is as a result of their role as a vector of pineapple wilt. This devastating disease is caused by Pineapple mealybug wilt associated virus-2 (PMWaV-2), a mealybug-transmitted ampelovirus. There are two types of wilt, quick wilt and slow wilt. Quick wilt, also known as mealybug wilt, develops around 2 months after a short attack by a large colony of mealybugs, whereas slow wilt is caused by many mealybugs feeding on the plant tissue over many months. Slow wilt causes the inner leaves to turn dry and brown, and causes outer leaves to lose their turgidity and droop. Unlike slow wilt, quick wilt causes leaves to turn a yellow-pink colour. In plants younger than 6 months, quick wilt causes inner leaves to turn light green to pale yellow or pink. In older plants, quick wilt causes leaves to droop, turn pink and dry out. Both types of wilt cause leaves to droop and dry out. They also both affect the fruit yield of the plant, especially if symptoms are seen early in the season. ',

          treatment: 'Prevention - controlling mutualistic ants will prevent the build-up of mealybug populations, by reducing the protection the mealybugs benefit from and by allowing natural enemies to prey on any mealybugs present. Physical barriers such as ant fences have shown partial effectiveness, but the most effective ant control involves the use of insecticidal baits. A commonly used chemical for these baits is hydramethylnon; Control - although it is thought that the control of ants is an effective way to prevent the build-up of D. neobrevipes, the mealybugs themselves may also need controlling. Even if mealybugs have already established and symptoms of pineapple wilt have been observed, control should still be implemented as recovery can be rapid if the appropriate control measures are put in to place; Movement Control - controlling ants will prevent them from transporting mealybugs further in an area. The use of wind barriers around the edge of the field can reduce the number of mealybug crawlers (first instars) that are spread by the wind to uninfested areas; Biological Control - D. neobrevipes has a range of natural enemies that, in the absence of caretaker ants, can effectively control populations of the mealybug. New predators can be introduced to an area in order to control the mealybugs, but without first controlling ant populations, these introductions will not be effective; Chemical Control - chemicals can be effective at controlling D. neobrevipes, but if the mealybugs are feeding deep in the plant, they will be hidden from the application of insecticides. The waxy coating on the mealybugs may prevent penetration of chemical sprays, reducing their effectiveness. Insecticides that have been used in the control of mealybugs include the organophosphates malathion and diazinon.',

Biological control efforts were mostly stopped post-World War II with the development of broad-application insecticides. There are many more natural enemies of the pineapple mealybug for other crops where they are generally considered a minor pest. Biological control is much less effective when ants tend to the pest because the ants will actively defend the pineapple mealybug from harm. There are, so far, no good biological controls for ants tending pineapple mealybug, as the major predators of these ants are other ant species that drive the former out of the field. Mechanical/Physical/Cultural Control: Heat treating the pineapple crowns in a water bath at 50°C for 30 minutes rendered them free of Pineapple mealybug wilt-associated virus and made the crowns less desirable for pineapple mealybug colonization. The most successful control of the pineapple mealybug thus far has been through control of the ant populations that tend to the pest.

          treatment: 'Management of scale and mealybug insects begins with detection and identification of the pest. Mealybugs can be very small or resemble disease organisms or even plant structures, making detection difficult. Regular monitoring will allow detection of these pests before damage is obvious and will also allow improved control. All plant parts need to be searched, including the undersides of leaves and stems. Inspection of plants prior to introducing them into the landscape, nursery or collection is very important in reducing new infestations of scales. Management can be difficult because of the waxy material mealybugs produce which provides protection from many insecticides. Pruning or washing infested plant parts can be helpful in reducing populations, particularly in cases of small infestations. A brisk wash spray of water can also be helpful in removing mealybugs from plants and reducing the population. Mealybugs are commonly attacked by predators, parasites and diseases which can help manage populations, particularly for long term control. It is important to recognize the presence of beneficial insects and to take steps to conserve them in the environment so they are available to control the pest insects. It is often necessary to manage mealybugs with insecticides so it is important to select appropriate insecticides, timing and application methods to reduce negative impact on the natural enemies but still get maximum control. Contact insecticides commonly provide quick knockdown of the pest but require good coverage and generally repeat applications. The stage most susceptible to contact insecticides is the crawler stage. Horticultural oil and insecticidal soaps also can provide good control, but must be treated like contact insecticides, which require thorough coverage and repeat applications. Systemic insecticides can provide excellent options for scale control and can provide some flexibility in application timing and methods. These insecticides move through the plant and provide an excellent way to expose scale insects to the insecticide when they feed on the plant. It is important not to overuse or misuse insecticides which can lead to numerous problems including insecticide resistance. To avoid insecticide resistance it is critical to rotate among insecticide groups.',

          effect: 'C. cramerella has become the most important insect pest of cocoa in many parts of South-East Asia over the past 150 years. C. cramerella causes losses to cocoa by boring in the placental tissues and the wall of the pod, disrupting the development of the beans. Feeding results in pods that may ripen prematurely, with small, flat beans, often stuck together in a mass of dried mucilage. The beans from seriously infested pods are completely unusable, and in heavy infestations over half the potential crop can be lost. In light infestations there is no loss, but control may still be needed to prevent higher infestations from developing.',

If pods are cut open, characteristic tunnels and scarification caused by feeding commonly cause beans to stick together. Harvested beans clump together in severe infestations and may be impossible to extract from damaged pods.',

Eggs: Eggs are yellow-orange, flattened and just visible to the naked eye (ca 0.5 x 0.2 mm). Rectangular indentations cover the surface of the egg. On hatching, eggs become translucent, the shell being whitish but darkened by faeces within. Larva: First-instar larvae are translucent white in colour and ca 1 mm long. Late-instar larvae are ca 10 mm long and creamy coloured while still inside the pod, but greenish after they emerge to pupate.

          description: 'Coconut scale resembles other armored scales in that the body is protected by a waxy cover. Infestations may be noted by the formation of closely packed colonies composed of what resemble miniature fried eggs. Females develop through two nymphal stages, while males have an additional non-feeding pre-pupal stage (four immature stages). Positive identification of coconut scales requires that adult females be slide mounted and the diagnostic characters observed at high magnification. Eggs: Freshly laid eggs are smooth, elongate and whitish, becoming pale yellow over time. Eggs are laid under the scale cover around the body of the female. Mean length and width of eggs are 0.22 mm and 0.09 mm, respectively. First instar nymphs: Newly hatched nymphs (also called crawlers) are free-moving and recognized by the presence of legs, antennae, and a pair of bristles at the tip of abdomen. Crawlers are light green to yellowish brown, translucent and somewhat oblong, with an average length and width of 0.23 mm and 0.11 mm, respectively. Second instar female: Females remain pale yellow, circular and somewhat transparent in the second instar, which lasts for 8-10 days. Females nymphs are 0.6-1.1 mm long. Male nymphs: Development of male characteristics starts in the middle of the second instar. Male covers become reddish brown and more elliptical in shape, and then transform in stages into the pre-pupal, pupal and adult stages. The second instar lasts for 5-8 days for males. The male pre-pupal and pupal stages are spent under the scale produced by the second instar. Adult females: Adult female coconut scales have a circular or broadly oval cover that is 1.5-2.0 mm in diameter. The cover is flat and translucent with a subcentral pale exuviae. Bodies of slide-mounted specimens are 0.7-1.2 mm in length with a pyriform and membranous body. Diagnostic characteristics include: three pairs of lobes with no indication of a fourth pair; plates long, flat and fringed; and with sclerotization on the dorsum of the pygidium. Adult males: Adult male coconut scales are small, two-winged, reddish, gnat-like insects with eyes, antennae, three pairs of legs and long appendages. Adult males do not feed and are short lived.',

          treatment: 'Biological Control: Over 40 species of parasitoids and predators, and several fungal pathogens, are known to attack coconut scale.  In the absence of these natural enemies, population explosions of this pest can occur. Aphytis melinus DeBach and Aphytis lingnanensis Compere (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) are the most common parasitoid species controlling the coconut scale populations in Fiji and the Philippines. Aphytis melinus and/or another parasitoid, Comperiella bifasciata Howard (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae), were introduced into Hawaii, California, Argentina and other regions for the control of coconut scale. Cultural control: Pruning and training of fruit trees and proper disposal of infested leaves, branches and twigs will help control scale insects on nursery plants and trees. Excessive use of plant fertilizers contributes to scale outbreaks. Chemical control:  Various insecticides are registered for control of armored scales in ornamental and fruit crops. Crawler stages are generally the most susceptible to insecticides. Contact action insecticides, including horticultural oils, become progressively less effective once the scale insects develop their waxy cover. Insect growth regulators may be effective, provided they are applied when the immature stages are present. Location of the insect on the plant, growth stage of the plant, and solubility of the insecticide influence the effectiveness of systemic insecticides applied for control of armored scales. Several spray applications at 15-20 day intervals may be necessary for complete management of a heavy infestation. The toxicity of insecticides to parasitoids and other beneficial insects should be considered before starting a spray program for scale insects. Since coconut scale is a quarantine pest in many areas, phytosanitary treatment with gamma irradiation has been developed as a potential control measure for this scale.',

A single attack may be followed by others on the same palm. These attacks subsequently produce fronds which have wedge-shaped gaps or the characteristic V-shaped cuts to fronds.',
          description: 'Although Oryctes rhinoceros is found in several regions of the world, its shape, size and color are generally consistent. Adult beetles range from 1.2 to 2.5 inches in length (3.0 to 6.3 cm) and are dark brown or black. The ventral surface (underside) of males and females has reddish-brown hairs, but the female has a fuzzy grouping of these hairs at the tip of the abdomen. Both males and females possess a similarly sized horn used for leverage when moving within tightly-packed leaves or within the cavities they create in the crown of palms, the horn length is longer on average for males. Oryctes rhinoceros larvae (grubs) are milky white with red heads. The body is C-shaped, has three pairs of segmented legs, and is grayish posteriorly. Over the course of three instars, or phases between molts, they grow to 4.0 inches long (10.0 cm).',

          treatment: 'Detection can be difficult due to the beetle’s nocturnal activity and residence within trees. Visual signs such as holes bored at the base of leaves and V-shaped feeding damage help locate this beetle. Once detected, management and control are required to mitigate the economic impact of a beetle infestation. Control: Historical control of scarab beetle pests has included chemical and biopesticides, biological control (predators, parasitoids, and pathogens), and trapping with lures. Traps for the coconut rhinoceros beetle contain 4-methyloctanoate, an aggregation pheromone produced by the male beetle. In breeding sites, the fungus Metarhizium anisopliae may be applied for larval control and is distributed by adults. This fungus acts as a biopesticide on immature stages of the beetle. Viruses in the genus Nudivirus have also been associated with Oryctes rhinoceros and may play a role in controlling the beetle in regions where they are invasive. Infection by Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirusdeforms and may kill larvae, and hinders oviposition by females. However, the nudivirus may harm other species and genera of scarabs. In Korea, farmers of Allomyrina dichotoma (Japanese rhinoceros beetle) face a potential disaster if the nudivirus were to infect their populations, which consist of hundreds of larvae grown together in large plastic containers. These beetles are cultivated for sale as pets and to be used in gambling. The result of a Korean study in which Allomyrina dichotoma larvae were infected with the nudivirus was that 60% died in six weeks. There is also concern that the nudivirus may be transmitted to wild populations of Allomyrina dichotoma. There is no clear indication that the Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus is the major pathogen responsible for losses of Allomyrina dichotoma in Korea and tests are ongoing. Management: Managing the coconut rhinoceros beetle involves removing or destroying organic material that supports larval development such as decaying logs and stumps, removing dead palms, and removing piles of leaves and grass. A study on burning the downed and decomposing trunks of oil palms has shown that only partial burning of sites is ineffective in managing population levels of Oryctes rhinoceros.',

          symptoms: 'Both adults and larvae damage the leaflets of young unopened fronds. They graze away the leaf surface in streaks, which are typically parallel to the midrib. The narrow feeding scars enlarge to form irregular, brown blotches as the frond opens. The brown areas shrivel and curl, giving the leaf a characteristic scorched, ragged appearance. Large areas of the leaflets break off leaving the foliage partially skeletonized and its effective photosynthetic tissue may in extreme cases be reduced to virtually nothing. As the leaflets separate when the fronds expand, the adults move to attack younger leaves. They leave narrow chewing marks, which are individually less damaging than larval feeding. Adults cause more damage than larvae due to the longer duration of this stage. The shorter interval between the opening of successive fronds on mature palms, and their larger size, contribute greatly to their relative freedom from attack. A mature palm may be expected to produce a new frond every 4-5 weeks. In young palms, after the rapid emergence of the first few seedling leaves, the fronds are produced less frequently and over the first 4-5 years of its life a young palm will, on average, produce a new frond only once in every 6-7 weeks; under adverse conditions the interval may exceed 8 weeks. Thus, on a young palm there is never more than one frond vulnerable to attack at any one time, and there is usually an interval between the opening of consecutive fronds when there is not one at a vulnerable stage. This results in all immigrant beetles becoming concentrated on those palms which do have a vulnerable frond, and the relatively small size of the fronds renders the damage more devastating. The fronds are larger in mature palms and there may be more than one infested frond at any one time; so that, although the number of beetles may be greater, there is less damage. The rate of frond production gradually speeds up after the palm is about 5 years old, and, by the time it is 8-10 years old, the palm will be producing new fronds at the normal interval of one every 4-5 weeks. It is significant that, at this age, healthy, vigorous palms achieve relative immunity to severe beetle attack.',
          description: 'Eggs: The brown eggs are elliptical, about 1.5 mm long and 1 mm wide, with each end broadly rounded. The slightly convex upper surface has the chorion with a honeycomb sculpturation. They are fixed to the leaf surface by a cementing substance. Larva: The larvae are whitish in colour. The head of the first stage larva is comparatively large compared with the body. The entire cuticle is more densely covered with minute spicules. A seta arises from about the middle of the lateral margin of each thoracic segment, with two setae on each of the abdominal lateral processes. Each process of the tail-shovel bears a large, sharp, curved spine at the inner angle, and a series of five or six setae along the dorsal and ventral margins. The larva is about the same length as the egg, but about 0.75 mm in width. The second-instar larva resembles the full-grown larva more than the first instar. The lateral abdominal processes are longer, each bearing four setae which are comparatively longer than those of the fully developed larva and situated at different points around the periphery of the apex. There are eight setae on the prothorax (four on each side) and six on the meso- and metathorax (three on each side, two setae on the produced part and one posteriorly). The distinct spine at the inner angle of each prong of the tail-shovel is not prominent as in the first-instar. The fully developed larva has the body moderately flat, almost parallel-sided, very slightly and gradually narrowed from the prothorax towards the apex, composed of 13 segments (one head, three thoracic and nine abdominal). It is almost 9 mm long and 2.25 mm wide. The anus is situated ventrally on the ninth segment, if the fold at the anal orifice is considered as representing a segment, then the abdomen should be regarded as 10-segmented. The distinct head bears a pair of 2-segmented antennae; a group of five ocelli, three in a line and two in another, situated behind the antennae; a pair of apically bidentate mandibles. The thoracic segments are broader than they are long, the mesothorax very slightly broader than the prothorax and the metathorax very slightly broader than the mesothorax. The dorsal surface of the prothorax is more strongly sclerotized with a fine median suture and laterally rounded. The meso- and metathorax bears laterally a small knob in the middle, bearing two fine, short setae. There is a pair of well developed 3-segmented legs on each thoracic segment, each terminating in a single claw and fleshy pad-like structure. Each of the first seven abdominal segments is broader than it is long; each of the first three segments is somewhat shorter than the following segments; the eighth and ninth together form the terminal tail-shovel. Each segment bears laterally a moderately long process, ventral to the spiracles. A lateral process is a conical structure projecting horizontally nearly from the middle of the margin, except in the fifth, sixth and seventh segments, in which they appear to arise more from the posterior part. The apical part is subconical and distinctly thinner than the basal part. The entire surface is densely covered with spinules. The apical part bearing three or four setae. The tail-shovel is longer than broad, apically deeply concave, the prongs bent inwards and bluntly-pointed. The upper ridge on each side bearing nine spinules, three smaller on the basal part nearer the large spiracle, four larger on the middle part and two smaller on the bent apical part. There are 4 small spinules on the lower ridge more widely spaced than those on the upper ridge. The upper surface is concave, bearing many irregularly placed transparent areas and the ventral surface is flat. There are 9 pairs of spiracles, one thoracic, between the pro- and mesothorax, situated on a conical structure resembling a lateral process, and one pair dorsally situated on each of the first seven abdominal segments. The larvae undergo five instars which can be distinguished on the morphometrics ( in mm) of the tail-shovel as follows: L1, 0.33, mean 0.13; L2, 0.47, mean 0.20; L3, 0.65, mean 0.29; L4, 0.82, mean 0.37; L5, 0.94, mean 0.45. Pupa: The head bears three processes, one median and one on each side. Each lateral process is fleshy, broadest basally, pointed apically, pre-apically bearing small blunt spine. Thorax with meso- and metanotum each bearing a pair of wings. The abdomen is 9-segmented, the eighth and ninth segments are fused. Each of the first six segments bears laterally a pair of spiracles opening dorsally. Each segment bearing spinules arranged as follows: no spinules on first segment; from segments 2 to 7, two groups of four in transverse line, one nearer the basal margin and the other nearer the apical, those of the basal group are comparatively larger and more widely-spaced, those of the apical line are situated in the intervals of the spinules of the basal group; on segment 8 only two in transverse line near the basal margin. Dorso-laterally bearing a longitudinal series of spinules, one on each of the first seven segments, situated a little posterior to and more inward than the corresponding spiracle (on the seventh in a similar position). Anterior to each spiracle on segments 3 to 6 and in a similar position on 7 is a spine. Laterally on segments 1-7 bearing a group of closely placed spinules bearing moderately long setae, the spinules being less prominent on segments 1-2, or 3. Ventrally, only segments 4-7 bearing spinules. The prongs of the tail-shovel are more slender, somewhat longer than those of the larva, and also lack lateral spines or setae. The last larval exuvium is always retained on the prongs of the tail-shovel. Adult: The adults 8.5-9.5 mm long, 2.00-2.25 mm wide; length of antenna, 2.75 mm. The males are slightly smaller than females. Their colour varies geographically from reddish-brown in Java, to almost black in the Solomon Islands and Irian Jaya. Some specimens have the elytra brown or black, or have a spindle-shaped black marking on the elytral suture. Considerable overlapping of these forms, which were long regarded as distinct species, occurs.',

          treatment: 'Cultural control: A surgical method of control has been attempted in the Solomon Islands; this involved cutting out and destroying the central unopened frond which harbours the pest.  This procedure must be conducted over a large area at one time to reduce re-infestation from neighbouring palms and must be repeated fairly often to be effective. Palms which were 3-6 years old could stand the loss of one leaf every 6 months, but younger palms could not as this caused too great a reduction in growth rate. However, this method is expensive and will not greatly affect the Brontispa population as a whole unless mature palms are also treated. Mechanical control of the pest by removing affected heart leaves is laborious and has very little effect. Chemical control: Chemicals used to control the pest must reach the insect in the narrow crevices between the leaflets and chemical treatment must be maintained throughout the year because B. longissima breeds continuously, with several generations a year. If beetles start breeding as soon as they reach the young palms, larvae will probably start appearing after about 1 week; if there has been any residual effect from insecticide treatment, or if the invasion rate is slow, it will be considerably longer before the larval population presents a serious risk. The application of chemicals at 10-day intervals was more effective than 3-weekly applications. Frequent applications of high volumes of spray, in excess of that required to provide satisfactory levels of control, caused slight phytotoxicity; growth and the production of new fronds was retarded. Satisfactory control can be achieved at low cost using a fine, low-volume spray applied from above to the central spike of each individual palm. Damage caused by Brontispa is considered serious enough for chemical control measures to be used on young palms. Chemicals recommended are carbaryl and trichlorfon. The pesticide is applied to the central spike of the palm. Trichlorfon eliminated Brontispa from isolated areas of young palms in Western Samoa. Monthly spraying of young coconuts with permethrin is also advocated in Western Samoa.',

Hold the leaf up to the light and view from the underside. The virus is spread by an aphid, Pentalonia nigronervosa. It takes more than 4 hours of feeding on a diseased plant before aphids become infected with the virus. But once infected, the aphids continue spreading the virus until they die. Aphids live for 15-20 days. The virus is not transmitted on tools or through the soil.',

          symptoms: 'The fungus invades bananas through the fine (hair) roots, travelling through the roots and stem in the xylem or water-conducting tissues. Spores are produced, and these and the growth of the fungus block the flow of water and cause a wilt. Another type of spore, a chlamydospore, is produced in the soil; this is thick walled and allows the fungus to survive when there is no host to infect. The first sign is a yellowing at the margins of older leaves, advancing towards the midrib. Leaves turn brown, dry, and eventually collapse. Disease symptoms move progressively from older to younger leaves until only a few of the youngest leaves remain green and erect, with the older ones forming a "skirt" around the stem. Eventually, all the leaves collapse. On some varieties the stems split. Internally, brown, red and yellow rings occur in the stem, at first at the centre and later, in cases of severe infection, spreading throughout the stem. Suckers may also show symptoms. Eventually, all parts above and below ground will die and rot. Fusarium wilt can remain alive in soil for long periods, perhaps indefinitely, as resistant spores, in infested plant debris or in the roots of other plants that are hosts. Spread of Fusarium wilt over short distances is by root-to-root contact in surface run-off water, in soil attached to vehicles, tools, footwear, and in unsterilIsed potting composts. Over longer distances, spread occurs both within and between countries in infected planting material.',

          symptoms: 'Symptoms vary depending on the strain of the virus, the variety of banana or plantain and the environment. The most common symptom is lines of yellow that run from the midrib of the leaf to the margin. These streaks are continuous or broken, and either scattered throughout the leaf or in bands. As the leaf ages, the streaks turn brown or black. Initially, the symptoms are similar to Cucumber mosaic virus.Infected plants may be smaller than normal and less vigorous, with smaller bunches. In some African countries, dieback and internal rotting of the pseudostem occurs. Differences between symptoms in different parts of the world led to them being described as distinct viruses. Molecular studies on the DNA of the viruses have confirmed the differences. Spread of the virus is in planting material, suckers primarily. Spread can also occur as plants in tissue culture if they are not tested properly. It is now known that the virus or parts of the virus can enter the DNA of certain varieties (e.g., AAB, ABB, AAAB types) and remain hidden there without showing symptoms. However, if bananas are grown under stress, such as occurs when they are growing as tissue cultures, the virus reassembles, multiplies, and symptoms appear. Spread between plants is by mealybugs, especially species of Planococcus and Pseudococcus, although how important they are is not well known.',

          treatment: 'Cultural control: Several cultural practices to manage black pod disease could be implemented in cocoa plantation. A spacing of 3.1 x 3.1m and pruning of trees are recommended for cocoa planting in order to allow more light and air flow around the trees. This will reduce the level of humidity that is causing black pod disease. The removal of pods with black pod symptom should also be done in favor to eliminate the source of inoculum. In another study, the utilization of litter mulch under cocoa plantation has been reported in Papua New Guinea, which has some negative effect on the population of P. palmivora, and therefore could reduce the pod infection especially at the beginning of raining season. Leaf litter showed rapid decline in pathogen recovery of colonized cocoa tissue after 18 weeks, relative to grass ground cover. More frequent ripe pod harvest (i.e. twice a week) and removal of infected pod on the ground was demonstrated to significantly reduced disease occurrence and improve pod yield compared to less frequent harvest and removal (i.e. once a month). In addition, scattered healthy pod on the ground should also be removed, as it will be infected and become the source of inoculum later. Sanitation is one cultural method to control for black pod disease. Sanitation practices include weed removal, pruning, thinning and removal of infected and mummified pods every two weeks in order to eliminate the source for inoculum. Phytosanitary pod removal was observed to significantly reduce disease occurrences by 9–11% to 22–31%, where this practice removes the source for secondary inoculum. However, increase in disease incidence after raining season was observed to be most likely due to the spread of inoculum from survival site by the rain. The application of fungicide following sanitation is commonly performed for an effective control of disease, as sanitation practice alone would not completely eliminate the source of inoculum and still causes greater black pod incident compared to sanitation followed by at least one fungicide application; Chemical control: The application of copper fungicide has been shown to significantly reduce a great number of black pod incidences in Nigeria. Metalaxyl (Ridomil) and cuprous oxide (Perenox) were identified to be successful in increasing the number of harvested healthy pod compared to the application of fosetyl aluminium (Aliete) and control treatment. On top of that, the timing of fungicide application has some positive effect on the final pod yield where this plot produced greater yield than the unsprayed plot. The application was done before August, which is before the main disease epidemic that usually occurs in September and October. The recommended standard for fungicide application to control black pod disease caused by P. megakarya for a season is 6 to 8 times of application in every 3–4 weeks. However, the adoption of recommended application was very low among farmers in Ghana. Therefore, an experiment with a reduced number of fungicide applications demonstrated that there was 25 to 45% reduction in disease incidence. In terms of disease control and yields, sanitation and three applications of Ridomil 72 plus (12% metalaxyl + 60% copper-1-oxide) fungicide showed a better control compared to sanitation alone and sanitation with one or two fungicide applications. However, reduced in fungicide application was shown to be significantly less effective than the recommended standard fungicide application. It was suggested that the understanding regarding the source of inoculum, the amount of infective inoculum production and how the disease is disseminated is important in order to identify the appropriate and economical method in fungicide application as well as for an effective control of the disease. For example, the application of fungicide on the trunk will help farmers to control the spread of the disease up in the canopy, as it is difficult to reach the canopy during fungicide application. This will eventually save more time, labor and cost for disease management; Cultural and chemical control: In Ghana, a study that combined the sanitation and fungicide application showed a significant reduction in the percentage of disease incidence, where greater black pod incident were observed from pods on the trunk than the canopy in control treatment (no fungicide application). This suggested that the application of fungicide on the trunk would protect pods from infection, therefore reduce primary and secondary infection rate, both on the trunk and in the canopy. In addition, the application of systemic (potassium phosphonate) with one and double injection (20 ml and 40 ml of fungicide for each injection frequency), and semi-systemic (metalaxyl) fungicide showed better control compared to contact fungicides (copper based fungicide) in both locations that were used in the experiment; Biological control: Heavy application of chemical fungicide would eventually leads to resistant of pathogen and causing soil and water pollutions. Hence, more sustainable and environmental friendly method should be established and implemented, such as biological control. Several species of fungi from the genera of Trichoderma was identified to be a beneficial endophyte, to control black pod caused by Phytophthora spp. An isolate of Trichoderma asperellum from soil was observed as a potential mycoparasite for P. megakarya where this fungus has the potential to reduce black pod incident under field condition in Cameroon. It was reported that moderate black pod cases (47%) occurred in the T. asperellum treatment to control black pod disease compared to trees with untreated (71%) and chemical fungicide (1.73%). In Brazil, a new species known as Trichoderma martiale Samuels, sp. nov. was identified as an endophyte on cocoa, which has the ability to reduce black pod symptoms cause by P. megakarya. This endophyte species survives on cocoa pods, and has the ability to establish a long endophytic association with the host (about 3.5 months). Nevertheless, the protection against black pod via biological control is not as effective as the control using chemical fungicides; Resistant variety: There is no specific variety of cocoa that shows resistant to Phytophthora infections and the establishment and utilization of resistant variety will be most likely depends on the region. Numerous breeding programs have been established worldwide in order to screen and test for local hybrids for disease resistant of Phytophthora spp. For example, a study in Cameroon assessed the performance of local cocoa cultivars (the southern and northern Cameroon cultivar) compared to the local and international gene bank cultivars. The local genebank cultivar consisted of F1 hybrid of Upper Amazon X Trinidad, and an international cultivar from Papua New Guinea, and Latin America were provided through International Cocoa Genebank, Trinidad. Based on the information provided by farmers and leaf disc test to assess resistant variety, the local cultivars selected from farmers field showed some resistant to P. megakarya compared to other varieties. Thus, it was concluded that there are some potential resistant varieties available in this area.',

Vegetative growth and berry growth and size are reduced and is generally related to the amount of rust in the current year. The impact of rust, however, can have a longer term impact. Leaf rust associated defoliation and the strong carbohydrate sink of the berries cause shoots and roots to starve and consequently to dieback, thereby reducing the number of nodes on which coffee will be produced next year. Since next year's production of coffee occurs on wood produced this season, the tip and shoot dieback caused by the rust can seriously reduce the following season's crop.

The powdery lesions on the undersides of the leaves can be orange-yellow to red-orange in color, and there is considerable variation from one region to another. While the lesions can develop anywhere on the leaf, they tend to be concentrated around the margins, where dew and rain droplets collect. The centers of the spots eventually dry and turn brown, while the margins of the lesions continue to expand and produce urediniospores. Early in the season, the first lesions usually appear on the lowermost leaves, and the infection slowly progresses upward in the tree. The infected leaves drop prematurely, leaving long expanses of twigs devoid of leaves.',

          treatment: 'Non-chemical control: Resistance varies with leaf age, particularly for susceptible varieties, with young leaves more susceptible than older leaves on the same plant. Plants with incomplete resistance, however, usually display the opposite response,with high resistance in young and low resistance in older leaves. Cultivars derived from Timor hybrid and the Icatu cultivar display this pattern. Light intensity also influences cultivar reactions. Leaves exposed to high light intensity are generally more susceptible to rust, varying up to 10 fold depending upon pre- and post-inoculation light intensity. It is an important consideration in setting up conditions for rust screening or evaluation. Overbearing coffee may exacerbate rust intensity. Additionally, leaves supporting rapidly growing coffee berries are more susceptible to infection than leaves that only support vegetative growth. High yielding coffee varieties are more susceptible than low yielding varieties. Chemical control: Fungicides to control of rust have been used successfully for a quite a number of years. The metallic copper fungicides have been the least expensive and most effective, with copper oxychloride formulations being the best. The dithiocarbamate protectant fungicides have been useful, but their short residual life and instability at higher temperatures and humidity have limited their widespread adoption. Their performance is better when mixed with copper fungicides. The systemic triazole sterol biosynthesis inhibitors have been effective, but high cost and occasional problems with severe defoliation (phytotoxicity) have been observed. Among the systemics, triademifon has been the best so far. The systemics have also been particularly effective when used in combination or alternately with copper fungicides, reducing the likelihood for the development of fungicide tolerant rust strains. Occasional problems with defoliation associated with the systemics, and their high cost, however, may limit their usefulness. Fungicide efficacy depends both on timing of application and complete placement or coverage of the toxicant. This latter factor is important, since redistribution by rain is very limited. Important factors are spray volume, droplet size, and coverage. In timing the application of fungicides, rainfall was generally the most important factor to consider. Sprays during the rainy season were recommended, and sometimes recommended before the onset of the rainy season. Studies showed that initial inoculum level and berry yield varied greatly from year to year, and it was necessary to include these factors in scheduling fungicide applications. Yield in coffee can vary from maximum to 10% of max yield, depending on cultivar and on the extent of defoliation and yield the previous year, due to rust. Only 2-3 fungicide applications were required during low yield years and 4-6 applications during high yield years. These schedules were developed empirically.',

          treatment: 'Prevention is the most effective method of managing M. coffeicola. Risk factors for this pathogen include: prolonged (24–72 hours) humid environment, poor soil nutrition, and plant stress caused by increased planting density, herbicide injury, weeds, drought, and over irrigation. To manage humidity a farmer can prune to allow for air circulation and ensure the soil has proper drainage. In order to maintain proper plant nutrition, soil testing and a fertilization regiment are essential for combating this pathogen. Plant symptoms such as chlorosis, leaf curling, and bronzing along the edges of leaves can be used to diagnose specific nutrient deficiencies. For example if a plant has leaves bronzed along edges, cupped down-ward; new leaves dead; eventual die back of shoot tips, then it is likely the plant has a calcium deficiency. To reduce plant stress, a farmer can use herbicides to combat weeds but must be careful not to damage the plant in process. Also to minimize competition between adjacent crops, it is important to properly space coffee plants in 8 ft. by 8 ft. areas. Stress can further be minimized if post and pre-harvest damage by machinery or laborers is avoided. To avoid wilting stress plants should be properly irrigated. However, if a crop already has M. coffeicola, copper fungicide is effective. In Hawaii, farmers often spray tri-annually, using 1.5-6 lbs of fungicide per 50–100 gallons water, containing 30-80% copper hydroxide. "Sprays should coincide with dry weather and calm winds. Three spray applications per season should suffice (occurring approximately once per month), beginning at flowering. Thorough coverage of the plant canopy is very important. Large farms in Hawai‘i utilize tractor-mounted mist blowers."',

In Theobroma, infection is usually first seen as a sparse white mycelium (web) on the bark surface. The surface mycelium is easily overlooked, particularly where the bark is wet. The mycelium spreads mainly along the underside of the branch and sterile pink/white mycelial pustules appear through cracks in the bark and through the pores of the swollen lenticels, about 1-8 cm behind the leading edge of the infection. Hyphae penetrate the branch, causing progressive death of distal tissues. Leaves distal to the infection turn light green in the interveinal areas and then scorch brown from the margins. The affected leaves remain attached to the plant for a long time, giving an appearance similar to that of a broken branch. The characteristic pink/white or pink/orange basidiomatal encrustation develops mostly towards the underside of the branch, although it can develop around the entire circumference of the stem; it can reach 2 m in length. The crust is initially smooth, but cracks and becomes paler as it ages. Conidia are sometimes produced, on orange/red pustules scattered over the bark surface. Long black streaks of coagulated latex or gums appear on infected branches of Hevea or Theobroma, and open wounds develop as the bark cankers and splits. ',

          treatment: 'Management of P. salmonicolor and Pink Disease can be very difficult given its wide host range, making cross-infection a concern. Cultural control can be implemented by pruning frequently and burning any infected branches removed. This is effective when the disease can be recognized in the earliest stages, but it is most effective when performed concurrently with fungicide application. The encrustation and conidial pustules are able to remain functional for a period of time after the infected branches have been removed from the tree. Fungicide use varies among countries affected by the disease. In India, pre- and post-monsoon application of fungicides directly on the trunk and branches of cocoa or rubber trees effectively prevented the disease, while application of a sulphur-lime slurry to tea shrubs worked best in Kalimantan in Borneo, and Validamycin A was found to be the most effective means of control on rubber trees in Vietnam. The use of fungicides prevents the basidiospores from germinating and causing infection.',

          symptoms: 'Symptoms of cadang-cadang develop slowly over 8 to 15 years making it difficult to diagnose at an early time. There are three main “stages” of defined series of characteristics: early, medium, and late stages. The first symptoms in the early stage develop within two to four years of infection. These symptoms include scarification of the coconuts which also become rounded. The leaves (fronds) display bright yellow spots. About two years later, during the medium stage, the inflorescences become stunted and eventually killed, so no more coconuts are produced. Yellow spots are larger and in greater abundance to give the appearance of chlorosis. During the final stage, roughly 6 years after the first symptoms are recorded, the yellow/bronze fronds start to decrease in size and number. Finally, all the leaves coalesce, leaving just the trunk of the palm “standing like a telephone pole”. Palms under 10 years of age are rarely affected by cadang-cadang; the incidence of disease increases until about 40 years of age and then plateaus. "No recovery has ever been observed, and the disease is always fatal". African oil palm has similar symptoms as coconut but also have orange spotting on palms.',

          treatment: 'Prevention and avoidance: Avoid wounding palm trunks at all stages of growth, maintenance, and during their harvest and transport for installation in a landscape. Do not drive stakes into palm trunks to secure them to trucks. Avoid contact of wounded palm stems with soil. Do not install sprinkler irrigation emitters that spray water on coconut trunks. Place irrigation emitters at least 12 inches from a coconut palm and direct them away from the trunk. Inspect plants for symptoms regularly; early treatment carries the best chance for success. Minimize stress by providing the palm with adequate nutrition, maintaining equable levels of soil moisture, and avoiding unnecessary cosmetic pruning. Avoid using spikes to climb the palms  for pruning maintence. Treatment: For early infections, chisel or scrape out the rotten portion. Treat wounded or infected areas with fungicide and tar (for example, Bordeaux paste, mancozeb, or copper oxychloride), followed by sealing with coal tar two days later. Burn or destroy the chiseled pieces. Apply neem cake to the base of affected plants. Advanced symptoms may be virtually untreatable, requiring palm removal and destruction.

          symptoms: 'It has been shown that the fungus usually requires wounds to infect the plant and necessary for the fungus to develop. The first symptoms of Pestalotiopsis palmarum begin as very small yellow, brown or black discoloration of the leaves. The disease can be restricted to the leaf blade or may only appear on the petiole and rachis right away. Spots and discoloration areas can be smaller than ¼ inch in size, but under optimal conditions can grow much larger eventually forming lesions. The spots will often turn a grayish color and will be outlined in black. Extreme wilting and a drying appearance on the leaves is also a major symptom of Pestalotiopsis palm. In mature palms, if the fungus is limited to only leaf spots, the disease may not be very serious and damaging. However, the fungus can severely affect juvenile plants if only a few leaf spots are present because they have yet to develop a trunk and only have a few leaves.',

          treatment: 'Wind and water movement easily disperses spores of Pestalotiopsis palmarum so sanitation and irrigation management can be proven to be critical in preventing the movement of the disease. Wounds and damage to the plant offer easy access for the fungus so the limitation of human and insect activity can be very beneficial. Limiting the length of time that the leaves are wet when exposed to high humidity levels also reduces the risk of inoculation. So eliminating overhead irrigation can prevent infection on leaves when there is favorable humid weather. Nutrient management is also very important in controlling Pestalotopsis palmarum. Nutrient deficiencies can cause chlorosis and necrosis of leaf tissue which then in turn creates a wound necessary for disease inoculation. Based on the amount of disease on the leaves, pruning the leaves may treat the disease, but one needs to decide if pruning the leaves is worth the nutrient deficiency that could follow depending on the growth stage of the plant. Fungicides are also available for managing the disease, but alone will not solve the problem. Fungicides will prevent infection of healthy leaves, but infected leaves will stay infected until the leaf dies. Using multiple techniques for managing Pestalotiopsis palmarum at the same time is recommended for optimal management of the disease.',

          treatment: 'A tree demonstrating phytophthora symptoms can sometimes be saved by removing the soil from around the base of the tree all the way down to the top of the main roots, cutting away any bark that’s oozy or dark and leaving the root system exposed. This allows the root system to dry completely, slowing the spread of phytophthora. In most other cases, phytophthora management is limited to prevention. Trees and shrubs, like azaleas, should be planted in well-draining areas, so their roots remain dry for most of the day. Phytophthora only needs four hours of standing water to germinate, making it difficult to combat in areas with poor drainage. Some gardeners get around this by planting their landscaping on mounds 8 to 10 inches tall and being extra careful to plant crowns at the same depth they were at the nursery (often indicated by a dark line on the trunk). Well-established trees are less frequently affected than younger trees because they have widely spread roots that provide lots of avenues for water and nutrition. If a few sections are damaged, they are prepared to compensate. In smaller plants, such as shrubs or vegetables, all bets are off — they can be lost to phytophthora before you even realize the disease has taken hold.',
